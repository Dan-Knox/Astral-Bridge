Astral is a cross chain Bridge and DEX which lets users bridge and rade assets across 9 EVM chains aswell as many legacy & non EVM chains such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Zcash etc. Users can bridge native assets in return for an Astral synthtic version of that asset (formerly ren asset) on the destination chain. Once bridged, users can then trade in astrals AMM contract (which will be deployed on all chains) with all other synthetic assets supported by astral. Since identical astral assets are minted on all chains and the fact that USDT is used as the AMM's base token on each chain, it can be garanteed that liquidity concentration for each possible token pair is the same amoung all chains. 

when a user briges a native asset into a synthetic asset and preforms a swap on the destination chain, that asset can be bridged back and swapped for the original native asset at face value.
